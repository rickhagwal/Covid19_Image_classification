# Detecting COVID-19 on Chest X Rays using PyTorch

#### Objective:

Image Classification Model, to predict Chest X_ray scans for COVID-19, that belonged to one of three classes of Radiography dataset: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19, with a reasonably high accuracy of 97.78% .

#### Dataset:
[COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle

#### Technologies used:
Deep Learning, PyTorch

#### Model Creation:
Used ResNet18 pre trained neural network on ImageNet dataset.

#### Training Model:
Trained model, until got accuracy > 95% on training datset, and evaluate on validation dataset-
